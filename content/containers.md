9. Copy the following code into a script named <b>ingredients.py</b>.

    ```python
    ingredients = [
        "Beef fillet",
        "Vegetable oil",

    Then add code to:
    - Add `Egg yolks`
    - Replace `Vegetable oil` with `Olive oil`
    - Remove the `Sugar`
    - Insert `Butter` after the `Mushrooms`

    Finally, write to stdout each ingredient on a new line.<details>

    for ingredient in ingredients:
        print(ingredient)
    ```
</details>

11. What is output by the following line of code?

    ```
    >>> ("Hello")
    ```

12. What is output by the following line of code?

    ```

13. Copy the following code into a script named <b>movie.py</b>.

    ```python
    movie = {
        "title": "The Blues Brothers",

            "John Belushi",
            "Dan Ackyroyd"
        ]
    }
    ```

    Then add code to:
    - Update the year to 1980
    - Add a `cameos` key value pair that contains John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Ray Charles.
    - Remove the `reviews` key value pair
    
    Finally, write to stdout each key value pair on a new line.<details>
    <summary>Show me</summary>

    ```python
    movie = {
        "title": "The Blues Brothers",
        "genre": "Comedy",

        print(key, value)
    ```
</details>
